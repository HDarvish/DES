# Dynamics of Energy Systems
This is a repository for the Ph.D. course entitled "Dynamics of Energy System" provided by Prof. Teresa Donateo in the Department of Innovation Engineering at the University of Salento, Lecce, Italy, in 2023.
Here I am going to add the exercises and the final project.
The first excercise is modeling a water tank using Simulink.
